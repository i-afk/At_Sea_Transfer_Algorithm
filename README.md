# At_Sea_Transfer_Algorithm
Algorithm script from 2023 Miami Hackathon, to dynamically detect illicit at-sea oil transfers from satellite images of tankers in the Black Sea (which had been identified using PyTorch) by comparing the distance between shipâ€™s hitboxes relative to the size of said hitboxes.
